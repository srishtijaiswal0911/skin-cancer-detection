# Skin-Cancer-Detection-System-using-Image-Processing
Major Project of final semester
Cancer image classification is an important task to generate classiÔ¨Åcation maps as no of world observation cancer increasing day by day 
These cancer contains different tools capable of capturing imagery time to time and utilized for a wide range of application. 
Thus classification of cancer imagery has current area of researches and classification results can be used for different real-time application.
This system proposed a novel approach for classification of six different classes:
actinic keratosis, Basel cell carcinoma, cherry nevus, dermatofibroma, Melanocytic nevus and Melanoma by utilizing Cancer imagery.
